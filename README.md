# YWCC307_GroupPresentation

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation for the group presentation conducted by Team YWCC307 on the topic of Marriott International's AI strategy for its hotel brands in Singapore.

## Presentation Focus

The presentation focused on evaluating Marriott International's AI strategy in response to the growing consumer trust towards AI engagements in the hospitality industry, particularly in Singapore. Our aim was to provide insights into whether Marriott should deploy guest-facing AI solutions in Singapore and, if so, which AI solutions would be most suitable for implementation across its hotel brands.

## Problem Statement

Marriott International, the second largest hospitality player in Singapore, is under pressure to innovate and review its AI strategy for its hotel brands. The increasing uptake of AI among hospitality players in Singapore, along with government support and successful use cases of front-facing AI solutions, has created an impetus for Marriott to reevaluate its strategies. Our team analyzed the potential benefits and challenges of deploying guest-facing AI solutions and provided recommendations based on our findings.
